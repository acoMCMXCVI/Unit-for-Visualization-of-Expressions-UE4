## Description

The project was done as part of my B.Sc. thesis. 

Unit for visualization of facial expressions is a computer station with appropriate software support, which is part of the system (shown in the figure below) for real-time transferring facial expressions of the actor to digital character. 

The unit obtained input data from the data analysis and processing unit (https://github.com/acoMCMXCVI/Data-Analysis-and-Processing-Unit), that is to say, sequence of facial movements in time, transfers to digital character in real time, and then for output data gives sequence of images (renders).
